# How to create candlestick chart using the Flutter charts widget?

Our Cartesian chart widget provides financial chart support. The candlestick provides information about the open, close, high and low price over a particular period. Here if the opening price is higher than the closing price, the candle is filled and if the closing is higher than the opening price, then candle is unfilled. The wick at top represents the highest price and the wick at lower represents the lowest price of a particular period.
